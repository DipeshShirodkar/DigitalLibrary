Indian languages, including Marathi, 
that belong to the Indo-Aryan language family are derived from early forms of Prakrit. 
Marathi is one of several languages that further descend from Maharashtri Prakrit. 
Further changes led to the formation of Jain Apabhraṃśa followed by Old Marathi.[11] 
However, this is challenged by Bloch (1970), who states that Apabhraṃśa was formed after Marathi had already separated from the Middle Indian dialect.
