The digital library system allows users to log in with their unique ID. 
Upon successful authentication, the user can browse different categories of books and select a specific type of book. 
Using the book's unique ID, they can choose a particular book from the catalog. 
The system then provides the user with two options: they can either read the book online or lease it for offline access.
Based on the userâ€™s selection, the system processes the request accordingly, ensuring a smooth and personalized experience.
